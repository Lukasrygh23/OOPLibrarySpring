# OOPLibrarySpring


This is a web-based program that can query an IMS database. It can create theoretical Ebooks and temporary 'Licenses' for them. 
This is purely the back end of the program, and requires either postman or the front end website to function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* MySQL 8.0.

* Java 11

You must also have [The front end](https://github.com/Lukasrygh23/OOPLibraryHTML) downloaded and ready to use.

### Installing

No installation is required, but you must have MySql 8.0 or greater on your system first and ensure the MySQL server is running.
 
## Running the tests
### Unit Tests 

All tests can be run using JUnit.

The Selenium tests require the chrome browser to be installed and updated to the most recent version, and the front end in Prerequisites to be hosted on a server (Visual studio supports this with some addons).

## Built With
