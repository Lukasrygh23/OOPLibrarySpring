# OOPLibrarySpring

This is a web-based program that can query an IMS database. It can create theoretical Ebooks and temporary 'Licenses' for them. 
This is purely the back end of the program, and requires either postman or the front end website to function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* MySQL 8.0.

* Java 11

You must also have [The front end](https://github.com/Lukasrygh23/OOPLibraryHTML) downloaded and ready to use.

### Installing

No installation is required, but you must have MySql 8.0 or greater on your system first and ensure the MySQL server is running.

### Unit Tests 

All tests can be run using JUnit, but the Selenium tests require OOPLibraryHTML to be downloaded and running through a server (I personally used Visual Studio's) to function. If it is not running, most of them will fail. 

## Built With

* Eclipse

## Versioning

We use Git for versioning.
