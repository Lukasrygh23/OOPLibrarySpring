# OOPLibrarySpring

This is a web-based program that can query an IMS database. It can create theoretical Ebooks and temporary 'Licenses' for them. In a usable state it would link to online repositories and download links for said books, but for ease of use the program is self-contained.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must also have [The front end](https://github.com/Lukasrygh23/OOPLibraryHTML/tree/dev) downloaded and ready to use.

### Installing

No installation is required. Simply run the fat.jar. 

## Running the tests
### Unit Tests 

All of the normal unit tests are self-contained.

The Selenium tests require the chrome browser to be installed and updated to the most recent version, and the front end in Prerequisites to be hosted on a server (Visual studio supports this with some addons).
